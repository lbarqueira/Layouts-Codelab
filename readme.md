Modifiers = Modifiers allow you to decorate a composable. You can change its behavior, appearance, add information like accessibility labels, process user input or even add high-level interactions like making something clickable, scrollable, draggable or zoomable. Modifiers are regular Kotlin objects. You can assign them to variables and reuse them. You can also chain several modifiers one after the other to compose them.
